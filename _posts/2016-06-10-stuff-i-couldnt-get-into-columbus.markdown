<p>Two Two Eight Two Four Five.</p>


<p>Young man,</p>
<p>There's an ATM across the street.</p>
<p>Use it - get some cash,</p>
<p>But first,</p>
<p>Do me</p>
<p>A favor and,</p>
<p>Get off the line.</p>


<p>I'll pay in cash.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help, man.</p>
<p>I pay you back.</p>
<p>This guy.</p>
<p>This guy though.</p>
<p>I don't understand.</p>
<p>What's with this guy though.</p>


<p>Are you going?</p>
<p>No no id rather stay</p>
<p>At home.</p>


<p>The fifty something</p>
<p>Year old lady.</p>
<p>From the projects</p>
<p>With the</p>
<p>And the </p>
<p>And the dog named</p>
<p>And the pregnant</p>
<p>And the ex on</p>
<p>And the love of dogs</p>
<p>And full of affection</p>
<p>For us even though we don't know her</p>
<p>For me even though I stole</p>
<p>Her story because I loved her</p>


<p>Yawns rumble</p>
<p>In the ears rumble</p>
<p>Dance floor rumble</p>
<p>Learn to dance rumble</p>
<p>Skin sweat water rumble</p>
<p>King and a queen rumble</p>
<p>A dozen jacks and their phones</p>
<p>Rumble</p>
<p>Jackshit</p>


<p>I like what you did</p>
<p>With your eyes</p>
<p>But I didn't tell you</p>
<p>And I kind of am</p>
<p>Losing course of where</p>
<p>I'm heading</p>


<p>Trinity tiger</p>
<p>It's natural</p>
<p>We all are trinity Tigers</p>
<p>We all tiger around</p>
<p>Two hundred of us tigers</p>
<p>Tigering tigers tiger other tigers</p>
<p>Tigers tiger other tigers tiger</p>
<p>Tigering many tigers</p>
<p>Expecting tigers to tiger</p>
<p>Tiger tiger tiger tiger tiger tiger tiger?</p>
<p>No tiger.</p>


<p>Did you not get the hint?</p>
<p>The hint?</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>Hint?</p>
<p>Well do I</p>
<p>Have new for</p>
<p>You my dear</p>
<p>Sir friend Madame</p>
<p>Mademoiselle</p>
<p>I like that one there</p>


<p>You are not the type</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>I will kill you if you don't</p>
<p>But I won't</p>
<p>Because I</p>
<p>Don't care about you</p>
<p>Enough to have the slightest</p>
<p>Inclination to help you.</p>


<p>Knees weak</p>
<p>Arms are in the air</p>
<p>Got you with my eyes</p>
<p>For the briefest moment</p>
<p>And away we go</p>
<p>And away I go</p>
<p>And away I try to find a way</p>
<p>To escape to another day</p>
<p>Another day down the road</p>
<p>Perhaps even a test day</p>
<p>It's late and time</p>
<p>To sleep</p>


<p>Dragons breath</p>
<p>Bursting out from the side</p>
<p>Alluring</p>
<p>Overwhelming</p>
<p>Spiteful jealous self harming</p>
<p>Two sides of a coin</p>
<p>A coin buried in shit</p>


<p>Dear maxi kaxi</p>
<p>Do you see what's going on</p>
<p>Do you see</p>
<p>How stupid I am</p>
<p>Let the fellow dream</p>
<p>Im no fellow</p>
<p>Who knows what I am</p>
<p>I only know I'm not</p>


<p>Four One Six Nine Five Nine.</p>


<p>Butterflies and lullabies pretending to fly free,</p>
<p>Flying thoughts and flowing dreams,</p>
<p>Foie gras of human flesh,</p>
<p>The best liars are the most honest,</p>
<p>Chewing gum and deodorant,</p>
<p>Lose.</p>
<p>Three free nowhere to be,</p>
<p>Damnation in a notebook?</p>
<p>Breathe in and then,</p>
<p>Breathe out with your nostrils,</p>
<p>Flaring.</p>
<p>I think Sylvia Plath likes vodka.</p>
<p>Find me if you want me to fill in the details.</p>
<p>...Except me and people who still possess a sense of taste.</p>
<p>Lots and lots of shitty...</p>
<p>He takes the easy way out.</p>
<p>Both of us take the easy way out.</p>
<p>Theres no... here.</p>
<p>Only flesh.</p>
<p>And sometimes that is alright.</p>
<p>And sometimes that is alright.</p>
<p>Acid slosh ceramic.</p>
<p>Dripping into whirling down.</p>
<p>I hope I'm not the root...</p>
<p>...Somewhere in the ballpark of six or seven.</p>
<p>Playing life...</p>
<p>I'm glad to be thought of as a friend,</p>
<p>When I'm hundreds of miles below,</p>
<p>Looking upwards at you with awe.</p>
<p>You make it out as if,</p>
<p>I'm just as special as you are.</p>


<p>Five Three Four Three Nine.</p>


<p>And listening to all the people around things get clearer,</p>
<p>Sometimes looking inwards does nothing to fix the problem.</p>
<p>But still, the key to the outside may be locked up inside.</p>
<p>Nothing much to say except that things just keep on going,</p>
