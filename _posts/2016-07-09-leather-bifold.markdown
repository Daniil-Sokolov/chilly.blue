Imagine you have a a5-sized sheet of 2-3 oz veg-tan leather and a giant laser cutter just lying around somewhere waiting to be used.

Now imagine you lost your wallet and need a new one.

Well, lets put that laser cutter to good use and make a wallet.

## Supplies
* An a5-sized sheet of 2-3 oz veg tan leather
* A laser cutter capable of cutting leather
* Some sort of leather dye
* Some sort of leather finish
* Brush or cotton swabs to apply dye and finish
* A thread and needle for stiching the leather
* [This .AI file to be used with Adobe Illustrator](/downloads/bifoldv5.ai)

## Directions
* Laser cut the pattern onto the sheet of leather.
* Dye and finish the leather while it is still connected to the rest of the sheet.
* Take out the two pieces. Fold the U-piece over the smaller piece to form the general shape of the wallet.
* Start a saddle stitch on the top of the card pockets. You could use a clamp to make this easier for yourself.
* Once you start stitching the side, remember to get all three pieces of leather. 

All in all, I don't think this tutorial is all too difficult. I don't have exact specs, but the wallet carries all the cards I have along with the rewards cards and such I get from coffee shops or other places. However, some cards, ones wider than a credit card, will not fit in this wallet. As for other "fitting issues", one may feel that the cash sticks out of the top. This is merely a matter of breaking in the wallet. One thing I don't like about this wallet is how soft and flimsy it is. In a way, that is to be expected. After all, it's made from 2-3 oz leather. Just don't go cramming two dozen bills or a dozen credit cards and you should be fine.
