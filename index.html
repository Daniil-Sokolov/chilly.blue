# Hi, my name is Billy Chiu.

I'm a Columbia University student who's probably gonna major in computer science and economics. On the side I'm an actor, a pianist, and a wannabe singer.

In the past, I've worked as a full stack web development intern at [DIDiT Labs](http://diditlabs.com/) and a investment/webmaster internship at [Rebellion Research](https://www.rebellionresearch.com/). I'm primarily interested in webdev and enjoy watching Safari become increasingly obsolete.

Much thanks to Yuka Miyanomae for the awesome drawing!
