Earlier, I was thinking of one of my favorite games growing up: [Dan Ball's Powder Game](http://dan-ball.jp/en/javagame/dust/). I remember posting things to the site to see how many votes I could rack up with my creations.

To give a sense of the enthusiasm I had for the game, here's [one of my more popular works](http://dan-ball.jp/en/javagame/dust/218608.html).

I'm really glad to see that Powder Game and its successors are still thriving! However, I also found out that the Powder Game chat that I frequented has been [abandoned](http://xat.com/1991roncampo). Tragic.

Anyways, try the following buttons, "r, g, b, c, space".
