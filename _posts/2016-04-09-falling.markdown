Earlier, I was thinking of one of my favorite games growing up: [Dan Ball's Powder Game](http://dan-ball.jp/en/javagame/dust/). I remember posting things to the site to see how many votes I could rack up with my creations.

To give a sense of the enthusiasm I had for the game, here's [one of my more popular works](http://dan-ball.jp/en/javagame/dust/218608.html).

I'm really glad to see that Powder Game and its successors are still thriving! However, I also found out that the Powder Game chat that I frequented has been [abandoned](http://xat.com/1991roncampo). Tragic.

Anyways, try the following buttons, "r, g, b, c, space". Also left click and right click. For whatever reason, the darn thing freezes the entire page for a good 3 seconds once you click anywhere... anywhere on the page..

<script src="/processing/processing.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<canvas id="Falling" class="expando-target" data-processing-sources="/processing/Falling.pde" width="500" height="500"> </canvas>

This ended up very bad. I guess it serves as an homage to the beautifully done Powder Game in a "look at how slow this is in comparison" way.

Either way, code below.

## Game

This was done in processing.js by the way. If I ever try to make a powder simulator, I think I'll user p5.js. I should also probably tackle "particles" in some other way.
