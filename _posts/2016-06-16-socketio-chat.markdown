This is my first time testing out Socket.io and it is pretty amazing! One of their demos involves making a [chat](http://socket.io/get-started/chat/), which happened to be one of my goals in making a web app for my old school.

Well, here is a slightly fleshed out demo for Socket.io. It includes identification through random numbers, private messaging, and a few other surprises that I'm sure you could figure out.

The chat itself is currently hosted for free, albeit with credit card identification, on through Microsoft Azure. The process was pretty painless and the service seems great thus far.
